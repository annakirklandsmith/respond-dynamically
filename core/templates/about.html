    <h2>GENERAL FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>What does OC Connect offer to the public?</strong></p>
    <p><a href="http://occonnect.info/">Community Resource Database</a> - A consolidated community listing of 700+ services and resources offered by government and/or non-profit organizations in Orange County.  OC Connect was created and is updated (with love) by the <a href="http://communityempowermentfund.org/">Community Empowerment Fund</a> with support from the Orange County Partnership to End Homelessness and is free and accessible to anyone online at <a href="http://occonnect.info/">occonnect.info</a>. Your feedback, as well as any changes or additions to the database are very welcome!</p>

    <p><strong>What does OC Connect offer to Orange County social service partners?</strong></p>
    <p>OC Connect is Orange County's Coordinated Entry system that works with households facing homelessness to match them with solutions that best meet their needs. In addition to connecting service providers to community resources, OC Connect administers <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/ending-homelessness/solutions/creating-systems-that-work/">nation-wide best practices</a> that include: homelessness diversion, connection to prevention resources, and a vulnerability assessment that prioritizes and coordinates care for the most vulnerable households in Orange County. The tool is made available exclusively to participating members of the HOME Task Force; for more info please reach out to Corey Root at <a herf="mailto:croot@orangecountync.gov">croot@orangecountync.gov</a>. We are excited about further developing this tool  alongside HMIS systems to meet the needs of coordinated entry in our community!</p>

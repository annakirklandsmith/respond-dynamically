What if resources weren't so scarce? And what if, when we needed it the most, we could get connected to support with the touch of a button?

OC Connect Mobile is a web-based solution designed to get our community connected to hundreds of resources throughout the Triangle. Utilizing the rich resource database managed and maintained by the Community Empowerment Fund, in collaboration with the Orange County Partnership to End Homelessness, we set out to build a responsive, dynamic, real-world application that will have an immediate impact on our community.
